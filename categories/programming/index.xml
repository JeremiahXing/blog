      <description>Multi-dimensional arrays in C can be somewhat confusing, especially when it comes to pointers and memory layout. This blog post aims to give beginners in C a kick-off and disenchant these concepts. In my humble opinion, if you master the pointers, you master the core concept of C language.
Before Starting: This post is inspiried by this question on stackoverflow. For an easy kick-off, better if you already have these pre-knowledges (but no worries if you don&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;ll share some links): basic understanding of memory address &amp;amp; pointers in C: https://www.</description>

      <title>Understand awk in Linux Shell</title>

      <description>What is awk? awk is a powerful scripting language and command-line utility for text-processing in Unix/Linux environments. It scans each line of a file, looking for patterns that match, and then processes the line accordingly (kinda like reduce in JavaScript but has difference). It&amp;rsquo;s excellent for manipulating structured text data like CSV, logs, or even simple text files.
Basic Syntax The basic syntax of awk is:
awk &amp;#39;pattern {action}&amp;#39; file pattern: A condition to match (like regex or conditional expressions).</description>

      <title>Shell Pipes: Simplifying Command Line Tasks</title>

      <description>Shell pipes are a powerful feature of command-line interfaces in Unix and Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS. They allow you to pass the output of one command directly into another command, creating a &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; of operations. This can greatly simplify your tasks and enable efficient data processing. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the basics of shell pipes and see some practical examples.
What is a Shell Pipe? A shell pipe, denoted by the | symbol, takes the output (stdout) of one command and uses it as the input (stdin) for the next command.</description>
